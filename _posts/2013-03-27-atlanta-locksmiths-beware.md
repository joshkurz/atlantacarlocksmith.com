    There has always been quite a lot of skepticism in Atlanta and its neighboring cities when it comes to reliable Atlanta Locksmiths. Especially those that are found on the first page of Google. This is an upsetting truth. Up until now there has not been a single act of chivalry in this industry. This will change very drastically here in the next few months.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Open Sesame has been taking it slow in the locksmith community, because we want to make sure that we have the ability to offer all locksmith services before we advertise for them. Well the good news is that we have teamed up with one of the most reliable locksmith companies in Atlanta to help build our knowledge base and take back the city. <a title="AmbuLock" href="http://ambulock.com">http://ambulock.com</a> does not have much of a website, but we can assure you that their locksmith skills are top notch. Not only do they have the skills to compete with the best, but they also have the network and knowledge of the Atlanta area locksmith community that has been kept under such a tight lock and key.  <a href="http://www.atlantacarlocksmith.com/sesameContent/uploads/2013/03/ambulock.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-373 alignright" title="ambulock" src="http://www.atlantacarlocksmith.com/sesameContent/uploads/2013/03/ambulock.jpg" alt="" width="278" height="97" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now that this partnership has been formed, all of the important locksmith information will become an intricate part of Open Sesame&#8217;s internal structure. This will allow for more competitive prices and trustworthy locksmith services to be spread throughout Atlanta. The real bonus of all of this is for the customer. Now that we feel confident about offering all locksmith services to the Atlanta area we are going to go on a full marketing rampage.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What this means to the competitors? They will lose more and more business as we are going to offer unheard-of prices in the market and will not be persuaded otherwise. Everyone will know the name Open Sesame in the next year to come as our marketing skills are unmatched by anyone in the industry. The competitors think that making dummy websites that funnel to call centers is good marketing when in fact all this does is hurt the industry. What the community needs is a trustworthy force on the streets that allows for a competitive locksmith industry to thrive in Atlanta.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Open Sesame does not want to put all locksmiths out of business. Just the ones that are doing shady work. We want to make it clear to the customers who the shady locksmiths are and what their motive is. The only way that they will be able to keep working in Atlanta will be to change their ways, because everyone will know what we are striving to do and our work and prices will be unparalleled.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We will always keep our $50 lockout special, but now we will offer all residential  commercial, and automotive locksmithing services. We will be doing a series on each different service and how we plan to offer the community competitive rates that are unmatched and unbeatable by the competition. <a href="http://www.atlantacarlocksmith.com/sesameContent/uploads/2013/03/unlockFuture.jpg"><img class="alignright" title="Atlanta Locksmiths Beware" src="http://www.atlantacarlocksmith.com/sesameContent/uploads/2013/03/unlockFuture.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="195" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There will be much change during this upcoming year and many people will be upset, but the customer will be happy and that&#8217;s all Open Sesame cares about.

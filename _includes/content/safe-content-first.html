    The price of safe moves can vary greatly. The price depends upon how far you need to move the safe, and how far the safe needs to go, once its on the ground. At the bare minimum, Open Sesame charge $399 to move the smallest safes. Then we go up from there. These prices are always discussed with the safe owner before we arrive to ensure that all parties are happy and content. This allows Open Sesame and its customers to have the most beneficial relationships possible.

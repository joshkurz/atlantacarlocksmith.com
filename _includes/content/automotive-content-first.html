    The locksmith industry in Atlanta has a bad reputation when it comes to Auto Locksmiths. This is because there have been scam companies created to try and take advantage of Atlanta patrons. These companies use tactics, like telling customers that they will charge $19 for a lockout. Then once they arrive they hike the price up and charge whatever they feel like. Since most people are very non confrontational, most people just pay and get on their way. This practice is the reason Open Sesame came into business. Open Sesame always thinks about the customer first. We always quote upfront prices and never change our price, once we arrive. This is why Open Sesame is the #1 Atlanta car locksmith.

There is no reason a professional should ever try to charge someone for unlocking their car in an emergency. If a baby is locked in the car, then anyone around with the tools capable to get the baby out, should do so. Earlier today a baby was locked in the car in Kennesaw Ga and Open Sesame was the first to respond to the scene with the proper tools.

    321 Open Sesame was called and told about this indecent. The callers were instructed to call the police, to ensure the fastest possible service. This did not stop Atlanta auto locksmith Josh Kurz who was there within 10 minutes. The car was unlocked within 1 minute of trying, which made everyone feel that Open Sesame was the qualified locksmith for the job. There were no injuries in this event, and everyone got to go home safely.

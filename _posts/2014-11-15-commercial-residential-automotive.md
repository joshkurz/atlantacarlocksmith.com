    The locksmith industry is full of opportunity for growth and expansion. This is especially true in thriving communities, such as Atlanta. There are three main sections of locksmithing, which are all covered by Open Sesame. Commercial, Residential, and Automotive locksmiths all have very unique talents, which make them especially valuable in there own way. These talents take years to master, but Open Sesame is bringing the people of Atlanta the truth, by offering wonderful locksmith service at a competitive affordable rate.

    The Residential work that Open Sesame provides to the Atlanta Metro area is as good as it gets. We offer anything from the basic re-key, to full house installations. We also offer high security locks, strike plates, and other security features, to keep families safe. We know that your home is one of the most important things in your life, if not the most important. This is why Open Sesame is dedicated to making sure all of our work is guaranteed and the customer understands that they can call us at any time for questions or details about the work that was done. Mainly in the residential arena, we cut costs by maintaining inventory and having a high level of organizational knowledge.

    Commercial locksmithing is very similar to Residential locksmithing. They both require a high focus on security and professionalism while the job is being completed. The difference between the two is mainly the types of locks that are used. Open Sesame keeps special commercial grade locks in stock to provide a cheaper installation fee. This allows us to stay competitive and provide ultimate customer service in the industry. Recently Open Sesame has taken care of businesses in Marietta and the Atlanta. We are looking to provide more service to these areas and others.

    The Automotive portion of Open Sesame&#8217;s portfolio is ever expanding, while all the while, becoming more and more focused on providing rare, and difficult services. There are not many companies in Atlanta that can cut the types of cars Open Sesame can. This is because they do not have the expertise in the industry that is contained within our organization. Open Sesame has always been proud of its ability to cut any type of car key. Whether it be a Buick or a Range Rover, Open Sesame will come through for the customer. Cutting keys is something that takes years of practice and perfection to ensure top quality service. We have been able to accomplish this by acquiring local talent, which is based out of Atlanta, and whom believe in the same customer service based goals as Open Sesame.

  <p>
    Over the past year, Open Sesame has served hundreds of customers in Atlanta, Buckhead, Sandy Springs, Kennesaw and many others. The key to our industry is loyalty to customers and having excellent customer service. This has always been the base of our operations and will continue to be. While we have been cutting costs in the industry for 3 years now, Open Sesame is dedicated to making sure our customers receive even better pricing and excellent service in the future.
